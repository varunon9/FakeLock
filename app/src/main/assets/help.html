        How to Play:

    <div class="accent-color rules">
        <p>
            You will have initially 8 stones to place on board (one in each turn).
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you are out of stones in hand then you can move your placed stones to adjacent positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your strategy should be to form triplet as well as block computer to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            On forming a triplet, you will get chance to eat computer's stone but you can't eat a stone which is a part of triplet.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you formed a triplet but all the stones of computer are locked i.e. part of some triplet then your health will increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eating computer's stone will decrease its health and at the same time you get more opportunities to form triplet.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the above rules equally applies to computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Player which make opponent player run out of stones win.
